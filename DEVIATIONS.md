# DEVIATIONS.md

Where the implementation departed from `JOINT_FIT_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, and why.

The plan's original text is deliberately **left intact** — it records what was believed when it was
written, which is worth preserving. This file is the single place to look for what actually
happened instead. Each entry gives: what the plan said, what was done, why, and the commit.

Entries are listed in the order the work happened.

## 1. Unplanned bug fix: `fb` perturbation step binned off the wrong telescope

**Commit:** `c838c96` (inserted during Step C1)

**Not in the plan.** `FisherM` chose the finite-difference step for the blend fraction by binning
against `s.fb[0]` (Rubin) unconditionally, then applied that step to `s.fb[tt]` — whichever
telescope produced the epoch. Roman's F146 blend fraction is routinely much higher (its PSF is
~10x smaller, per Step B3), so a step sized for a low Rubin `fb` pushed Roman's past the physical
bound of 1.0 and tripped `CHECK(s.fb[tt] <= 1.0)`, an uncaught `std::runtime_error` that
hard-crashed the program.

**Why it was fixed immediately rather than deferred:** it made *any* numerical verification of
*any* Fisher-matrix step impossible. Confirmed pre-existing by reproducing it on the unmodified
branch tip. Surfaced to the user, who chose to fix it as its own step rather than fold it into C1.

## 2. Step C1: `t0` appended at index 5 rather than inserted second

**Commit:** `5f39836`

**Plan said:** extend the photometric parameter vector to `{u0, t0, tE, fb, piE, xi}` — i.e. `t0`
inserted in second position.

**Done instead:** `{u0, tE, fb, piE, xi, t0}` — `t0` appended at index 5.

**Why:** the plan's ordering was illustrative, but adopting it literally would have shifted the
index of every parameter after `u0`. Those indices are hard-coded in roughly six places through
`co.resu[]` — the output printers, the per-field aggregation, `corr1`, and `f1`/`f2` — where the
photometric entries `resu[0..4]` sit contiguously against astrometric entries `resu[5..8]` and
derived quantities `resu[9..14]`. Reflowing all of that was an invasive, error-prone change with
no physical benefit: a Fisher matrix does not care what order its parameters are listed in.

**Consequence to be aware of:** the plan text and the code disagree on parameter layout. The code
is authoritative. Anything reading `Delta1[]`, `Era[]` or matrix rows by index must use the code's
order.

## 3. Step C2 split into C2a and C2b, with C2b deferred

**Commit:** `639309a` (C2a). C2b **not yet implemented.**

**Plan said:** Step C2 gives each band its own source flux and blend flux as free Fisher
parameters, and stores the model magnitude in its native band.

**Done instead:** the step was split. C2a — an unplanned preparatory refactor — replaced three
separate hard-coded uses of LSST's r-band with a configurable `RUBIN_REF_BANDS` list, defaulting
to `{2}` so it is a verified no-op. C2b, the actual plan content, was deferred.

**Why the split:** the user asked for the Rubin reference band to be selectable (any single LSST
band, or a custom combination) rather than fixed to r. That is a self-contained change with an
exact acceptance test — byte-identical output under the default — so it was worth landing on its
own before the much larger parameter-set change.

**What remains outstanding in C2b:**
- Baseline/source flux `s.mbs[]` is **not a free Fisher parameter at all** — only `fb` is. This is
  the same class of error that Step C1 fixed for `t0`: treating a genuinely free parameter as
  perfectly known makes every forecast too optimistic. It affects all three survey partitions.
- Model magnitudes are still not stored in their native band. Every Rubin epoch, whatever filter it
  was taken in, still collapses to one representative-band magnitude.
- The `Nx` growth / runtime / conditioning analysis the plan explicitly asks for.

## 4. Unplanned Step C0: Fisher matrices were never accumulated over epochs

**Commit:** `d5c8867`. Plan text corrected inline at Step C5 by `1efe919`.

**Not in the plan** — and it contradicted the plan's stated premise. Step C5's original text said
"`FisherM` accumulates `for (int i = 0; i < ndw; ++i)` over **all** data points." It did not. Both
accumulation sites used `gsl_matrix_set` (overwrite) rather than a running sum, and the zeroing
loops run once *before* the data loop, so every epoch clobbered the previous one and the final
matrix held a single data point's contribution — rank 1, hence singular, hence `invert_matrix`
nudged the diagonal by `1e-10` and returned an inverse of order `1e10`.

**Every sigma the code produced before this fix was meaningless.** A real detected event reported a
relative sigma of 1.8e7 on `tE`. After the fix the same event reports 0.0030.

**Why it went ahead of everything else:** Phase C is entirely about making precision numbers
trustworthy, and every later step builds on this one. In particular Step C5 partitions this
accumulation — partitioning a broken sum would have meant nothing.

**Related correction:** the degenerate synthetic-event result seen during Step C1 was recorded at
the time as a badly conditioned test fixture. That diagnosis was wrong; it was this bug. Corrected
in `OPEN_ITEMS.md`.

---

## 5. Unplanned: a synthetic Fisher-matrix fixture, built before Step C5

**Commit:** `7419e17` (`tests/fisher_fixture.cpp`, `make fishertest`)

**Not in the plan.** The plan assumes numerical acceptance criteria can be checked against the live
Monte Carlo. In practice detection efficiency in the test field measured 1 event per 886, 2600 and
10735 star draws on three separate runs, each taking tens of minutes. Step C1's acceptance
criterion ("on a handful of test events") ended up resting on a single event.

**Why it was built before C5 rather than after:** C3's step-size sweep and C5's per-event ratio
distributions both need many events, not one. The user chose fixture-first when offered the
alternative of widening the sky field.

**Design constraint worth remembering:** the fixture reads **no data files**, because `Baseline/`,
`CMD/` and the extinction maps are gitignored and absent after a fresh clone. It is a regression
harness, not a validation of absolute precision — events are hand-picked rather than
population-weighted and the error model is a flat stand-in for `errlsstM`/`errRomanM`.

---

## 6. Step C5 moved ahead of Step C2b

**Commit:** `1410cec`

**Plan order:** C2 → C3 → C4 → C5.

**Done instead:** C5 before C2b.

**Why:** the user objected to the C2b design on scientific grounds — they want the measurement of
how much each survey *helps* the other, and had no interest in Fisher results for events only one
telescope saw. Investigating that showed C5 subsumes most of C2b: once accumulation is partitioned
by `tele[i]`, `F_rubin` perturbs only `s.fb[0]` and `F_roman` only `s.fb[1]`, so both already have
unambiguous per-survey blend-fraction semantics. Only `F_joint` genuinely pools the two. C5 was
therefore both the higher-value step and the one that makes C2b smaller and verifiable.

**Decision recorded at the same time:** the joint/single gain ratio is computed only for events
where both surveys have data (`ndw_L > 0 && ndw_R > 0`); zero-epoch cases are counted as a
category, per the plan's Step F1 "three currencies" rule.

---

## 7. Part of Step C4 pulled forward into Step C5

**Commit:** `1410cec`

**Plan said:** Step C4 replaces "any crash-or-garbage behaviour on singular matrices with an
explicit *not characterizable* outcome."

**Done early:** `invert_matrix` now returns success/failure instead of nudging a singular matrix's
diagonal by `1e-10`, and partitions with fewer epochs than free parameters are rejected up front.
Invalid partitions report sigma `-1` as an explicit sentinel.

**Why:** C5 creates single-survey partitions that are *routinely* empty or rank-deficient — a short
event peaking in a Roman gap genuinely has no Roman data. Without this, C5's own output would have
been garbage on exactly the events that matter most.

**Still outstanding in C4:** normalization before inversion, per-event condition numbers, and
rejection of *near*-singular matrices. The current check only catches exactly-singular ones. A live
run found a 936-day event where Roman contributed 760 epochs and still produced a singular
photometric matrix, which the coarse check happened to catch — near-singular cases will not be.

**Related fix in the same commit:** `invert_matrix` was destroying its input, because
`gsl_linalg_LU_decomp` overwrites in place. It now works on a scratch copy. This was found by the
fixture's `F[joint] == F[rubin] + F[roman]` assertion and would otherwise have silently broken
C4's condition-number work, which needs the undecomposed matrix.

---

## 8. Unplanned: explicit synergy classification

**Not in the plan.** Added at the user's request after Step C5.

Events where one survey contributes real information but cannot characterize the event alone are
the strongest evidence for the joint fit. The live 936-day event is the motivating case: Roman
*detected* it and contributed 760 epochs, cannot characterize it alone (`okA[SROMAN] = 0`), yet
adding its data cuts sigma(tE) from Rubin's 4.41 d to 2.79 d.

A naive analysis computing `sigma_joint / sigma_roman` hits the not-characterizable sentinel on
exactly these events, and dropping the row would discard the best synergy cases — the mirror image
of the selection bias the plan warns about at Step C5. `SynergyClass` (`Bulge.h`) labels every
event `none` / `both-alone` / `rubin-only-alone` / `roman-only-alone` / `joint-only`, the last
being a pure joint-fit rescue where neither survey alone suffices. Recorded per event in
`EventRecord` and the output.

**Rule for downstream analysis:** never drop a row because a single-survey sigma is missing.
Classify it.

---

## 9. Step C1's acceptance criterion, closed late

**Commits:** `5f39836` (change), then closed properly once the fixture existed.

The plan required sigma(`tE`) to increase or stay equal on "a handful of test events." At the time
C1 was committed this could only be checked on **one** event, for the detection-efficiency reasons
in entry 5. It was closed later across all fixture events and every survey partition.

The result quantified the specific bias the plan predicted — that omitting `t0` "systematically
flatters the Rubin-alone column." Rubin's sigma(`tE`) was understated by up to a factor of 3.2,
while Roman's densely sampled partition barely moved (ratios ~1.00-1.02).
